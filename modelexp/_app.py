  Container class for everything. A modelexp app consists of five submodules
  The submodules are initialized in the following order
  gui - the interface for the user to see data, model and call the fit
  experiment - defines the general display and structure of the data to expect
  data - the experimental data, how the data looks, how it can be loaded and how visualized
  model - the means to calculate a model for the data, how to visualize it and how to store it
  fit - the code to find parameters of a model such that it fits to the data best

  The five submodules know of each other and can communicate with each other
